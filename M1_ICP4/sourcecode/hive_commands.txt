hive commands for Bonus
--------------------------------------------------------------
First we need to create two tables.
hive> create table petrol1 (distributer_id STRING,distributer_name STRING,amt_IN STRING,amt_OUT STRING);

hive> INSERT INTO petrol1(distributer_id,distributer_name,amt_in,amt_out) SELECT distributer_id,distributer_name,amt_in,amt_out FROM petrol;

hive> create table petrol2 (distributer_id STRING,vol_IN INT,vol_OUT INT,year INT);

hive> INSERT INTO petrol2(distributer_id,vol_IN,vol_OUT,year) SELECT distributer_id,vol_IN,vol_OUT,year FROM petrol;

Using Inner Join we join the tables,

hive> select distinct p1.distributer_id,p1.distributer_name,p1.amt_in,p1.amt_out,p2.vol_in,p2.vol_out,p2.year FROM petrol1 p1 JOIN petrol2 p2;

hive> select distinct p1.distributer_id,p1.distributer_name,p1.amt_in,p1.amt_out,p2.vol_in,p2.vol_out,p2.year FROM petrol1 p1 JOIN petrol2 p2 ON(p1.distributer_name="reliance");
